            <p>"Argentina is a country with beautiful landscapes and a unique culture. The favorite sport of most Argentines is soccer; we have won three World Cups. Additionally, it is a tradition to drink mate and have an asado (barbecue) every Sunday with family or on special occasions. We also play "Truco," a card game similar to poker. Argentines love to eat: empanadas, asado, and pasta are the most common meals. Dulce de leche is the richest and most consumed dessert in Argentina; we use it in many recipes, with Chocotorta being the most popular. Regarding language, we speak loudly and with an accent similar to Italian. We still use "vos" to say "you," and the famous term "che" is used to refer to someone in a friendly way."</p>
